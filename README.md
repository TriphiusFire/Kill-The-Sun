# Kill-The-Sun
A simple WebGL FPS I made from scratch with Three.js

you'll need the minified three.js script in the /js folder for this game to work

WASD - walk fwd/back, strafe left/right
Space - jump
Shift - move faster while held
left mouse - shoot

After each Sun Kill the floating blocks are allowed to go higher, you jump higher, and the sun goes higher.  The longer you play the crazier the experience.
