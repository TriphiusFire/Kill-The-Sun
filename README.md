# Kill-The-Sun
A simple WebGL FPS
https://triphiusfire.nz/webgl/JeremysWorld1.html to play it on my server

I took a beginner three.js course on Udemy, 5.5 hours of lectures, over 2 days, and then made this game on my own from scratch with the learned skill.

WASD - walk fwd/back, strafe left/right
Space - jump
Shift - move faster while held
left mouse - shoot

After each Sun Kill the floating blocks are allowed to go higher, you jump higher, and the sun goes higher.  The longer you play the crazier the experience.
